# OldLaggyRiscVfromHCMUT
Just an old "hag" of RISC-V piece, made for an assigment of Computer Architecture class from somewhere in Earth...

Simulated in ModelSim. Haven't taken it to the FPGA level. It's just too old. Such an ancient creature...

Help me by giving me a star. That helps a lot.

## Note:
I haven't updated my sheet about these simple RISCV design yet because I can't find them anywhere in my notebook.
Should retrieve this from a ton of folders...
